# Lists - In Python, List is a form of array. It is an ordered sequence of object that can be of any type. Like...

li = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
li1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
li2 = [2.5, 'Hi..', True]
# We can access lists items by their index like string.

amazon_cart = ['Notebooks', 'Sunglasses']
print(amazon_cart[0])
